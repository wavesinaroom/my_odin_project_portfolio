# Description

My portfolio project showcases the best projects I have developed for The Odin Project curriculum.
The project itself is also an opportunity to practice my CSS and HTML skills without the aid of a framework.

# Goals

* Put CSS animations knowledge into practice
* Put CSS responsive design knowledge into practice
* Practice semantic HTML code and explore accessability if possible
* Implement sound design to the website with the Web Audio API
* Use the no framework constraint to be creative
* Expand knowledge on github issues by including task lists inside of them
